      "  1. Vector databases such as FAISS store embeddings for fast search.\n",
      "  2. Embeddings represent text meaning as numerical vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vector databases, such as FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), are used for efficient similarity search and retrieval of dense vector embeddings. These embeddings represent text, images, or other high-dimensional data as numerical vectors, allowing for fast and accurate querying of similar data points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some common use cases for vector databases include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Text Search and Recommendation**: Vector databases are used in search engines, recommender systems, and content recommendation platforms to find similar documents, articles, or products based on their vector embeddings.\n",
      "2. **Image Retrieval**: Vector databases are used in image retrieval applications, such as object detection, image classification, and facial recognition, to quickly identify similar images or objects.\n",
      "3. **Information Retrieval**: Vector databases are used in information retrieval systems, such as search engines and databases, to efficiently search and retrieve documents or data based on their vector embeddings.\n",
      "4. **Clustering and Grouping**: Vector databases can be used for clustering and grouping similar data points, allowing for the identification of patterns and relationships in large datasets.\n",
      "5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Vector databases are used in NLP applications, such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and text classification, to represent text meaning as numerical vectors.\n",
      "6. **Facial Recognition and Biometrics**: Vector databases are used in facial recognition and biometric applications to represent face embeddings and identify individuals.\n",
      "7. **Content-Based Recommendation**: Vector databases are used in content-based recommendation systems to recommend products or content based on their vector embeddings.\n",
      "8. **Anomaly Detection**: Vector databases can be used for anomaly detection in large datasets, by identifying data points that are farthest from the mean vector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, vector databases provide a powerful tool for efficiently searching, retrieving, and analyzing large amounts of high-dimensional data.\n",

      "📚 Retrieved 2 relevant documents:\n",
      "  1. RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.\n",
      "  2. In RAG, relevant context is fetched before generating answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main advantage of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is that it leverages the strengths of both information retrieval and generation techniques to produce high-quality answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In traditional Generation models, the generator is responsible for producing an answer from scratch, without any additional information or context. However, this approach can lead to a lack of depth, accuracy, and relevance in the generated answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAG, on the other hand, first retrieves relevant context from a large dataset or knowledge base using a Retrieval component. This context is then used as input to a Generator component, which produces a more informed, accurate, and relevant answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main advantage of RAG is that it effectively combines the strengths of both retrieval and generation techniques. By first retrieving relevant context, RAG can:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improve accuracy**: By leveraging pre-existing knowledge and context, RAG can generate answers that are more accurate and reliable.\n",
      "2. **Increase relevance**: RAG can tailor the answer to the specific question or prompt, making the generated answer more relevant and useful to the user.\n",
      "3. **Enhance depth**: By providing a foundation of context, RAG can generate answers that are more comprehensive and in-depth, covering a wider range of topics and subtopics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the main advantage of RAG is its ability to strike a balance between accuracy, relevance, and depth, producing high-quality answers that are more informative and useful to users.\n"
