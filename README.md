# RAG Concepts - Hands-On Learning Labs

A comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebook labs for learning **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems from scratch. These practical, hands-on exercises guide you through building mini RAG systems using OpenAI API, OpenRouter, and FAISS vector database.

> **Note:** This repository is currently under development (20% complete). Content will be updated as the learning progresses.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

### Section 1: Introduction to RAG
- `part1.ipynb`

### Section 2: RAG Architecture Foundations
- `architecture.ipynb`

### Section 3: Embeddings and Vector Databases
- `embeddings_detailed.ipynb`
- `embeddings_openrouter_lab.ipynb`

*Detailed content descriptions will be added upon completion of the learning modules.*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **OpenAI API** - Large language model for generation
- **OpenRouter API** - Alternative embedding generation
- **FAISS** - Facebook AI Similarity Search for vector storage and retrieval
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Interactive learning environment
